# Don't be a jerk

Don't be a jerk!

A **key** part of our code quality standards is *"highlight flaws, don't hide them."* Nobody's going to do that unless they feel *safe* doing it. If you start attacking people for flaws in their code (i.e., being a jerk), this has adverse effects on the whole project.

We all know what it means to be decent to each other, right? So do it.

Incidentally, if you feel like someone *is* being a jerk, try to give them the benefit of the doubt first. That doesn't mean "tolerate jerks," but, you know, "is there an explanation for what this person said that doesn't involve them being a jerk?" is a good question to ask yourself.

Anyway, contributions from jerks will be rejected. Don't be a jerk!

*This is essentially just a description of what it means to be a grown-up. But, as evidenced by behavior in many places on the internet, it's apparently necessary to say.*
